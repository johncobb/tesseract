<div id='pre'>

## Prerequisites

- Install a [python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install [pip](#pip)
- Install a [Virtual Environment](#venv)
- Install the [requirements](#req)

<div id='pip'>

## Installing Pip

`curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`

`python get-pip.py --user`

<div id='venv'>

## Install virtualenv  

`pip install --user virtualenv`

Create a folder in tesseract/web/back to house the virtual environment (env). Also, specify this project is using python3.7

`virtualenv -p python3 env`

Activate environment  

`. env/bin/activate`

<div id='req'>

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To stop the virtual session  

`deactivate`

<div id='use'>

## Usage

Navigate to tesseract/web/back
Activate the [virtual environment](#venv)
```console
python server.py
```

<div id='end'>

## Endpoints

api/upload

<div id='ex'>

## Examples

### Python Example
Refer to test.py

### Curl
```console
curl http://0.0.0.0:3010/api/upload -F 'file=@path/to/file'
```

<div id='s3'>

### AWS S3
Set up awscli pip package and follow the directions from the below command
```console
aws configure
```

Prepping for zappa
See [Virtual Environment](#venv) to set up the virtual environment
The recommended name for amazon s3 and the virtual environment set up is env as I found that to be most successful
Once the virtual environment was activated run the below command
Navigate to the scripts directory
```console
cd scripts
```

Zappa set up
```console
zappa init
```
When it gets to what's your app's function OR django settings enter in server.APP
Make sure that zappa's aws region is set to an aws region (IE us-east-1 and NOT N. Virgiana)

If zappa recognizes the project as django you'll need to go to the zappa_settings.json file and change a few things
To change the it to a flask app change the django_settings to app_function
Make sure that app_function is set to server.APP

Once all is cleared and good to go run the below command
```console
zappa deploy dev
```

My stage name is dev so I used dev instead of something else
To check your stage name go to zappa_settings.json and look at the option you want to deploy
Check what's on the outside of what's connecting the settings you want to deploy to the outter layer

To get your route go to AWS API Gateway
Select the one that was generated by zappa
Most likely will be scripts-(stage name)
Go to stages
Click your stage name
Look at the Invoke URL
